We explored several tutorials and not all worked out of the box as expected, but we eventually got Text to Speech and Speech to Text functionality(the core of a voice assistant). The readme has been updated to reflect this requirements. We explored gTTS and pyttsx3 for text to spech and eventually settled on pyttsx3 because it is what worked quickly out of the box for us. Speech to text was straight forward using the SpeechRecognition library
